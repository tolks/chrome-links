Search Links in Chrome
=============

This chrome extension mimics Firefox's "Find As You Type Link" behaviour. The search is invoked when ' character is pressed and it searches for links that match typed text. A matched link is automatically focused so it is easy to follow the link by simply pressing Enter (or Ctrl+Enter to open it in a new tab). As with the normal search F3 makes it jump to the next match and ESC exits the search mode.

 It greatly simplifies navigation and will help people who are used to this behavior in Firefox.
